Easily display CodeCanyon items inside WordPress widget.

== Description ==

A simple WordPress plugin that fetches information from the Envato API and displays CodeCanyon items as a WordPress widget.

We have just modified it to fetch the information from codecanyon instead of themeforest, and replaced the categories to be output. All code is written by the awesome team at MeksHQ that creates the most amazing WordPress themes and if you have any issues with the functionality/compatibility of the plugin, please refer to their support page.
